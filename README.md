# NewtonOS

**NewtonOS** is a STEM-focused environment designed to provide powerful tools for learning, exploring, and solving problems in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The goal of NewtonOS is to build a versatile platform that can support a wide range of disciplines within STEM, including physics, mathematics, chemistry, and more.

Currently, the project is focused on **mechanics** and the development of tools for **kinematics, dynamics, statics**, and related subfields. The intention is to create a comprehensive environment where users can easily work through exercises, simulations, and problems in various scientific fields.

## Features in Development

### **Physics** (Currently focusing on Mechanics):
  - **Kinematics**: Study of motion without considering forces.
  - **Dynamics**: Study of the forces and their impact on motion.
  - **Statics**: Study of forces on stationary objects.
  - **Rigid Bodies**: Study of the motion of rigid objects and their interactions.
  - **Hydrodynamics**: Study of fluid dynamics and their interactions.
  - **Thermodynamics**: Study of energy, heat, and work, and their relations to physical properties of systems.
  - **Statistical Physics**: Study of systems with a large number of particles, including statistical methods to describe macroscopic phenomena.
  - **Optics**: Study of light and its interactions with matter.
  - **Quantum Mechanics**: Study of the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales.
  - **Relativity**: Study of spacetime and the effects of high velocities and strong gravitational fields.
  - **Particle Physics**: Study of the fundamental particles of the universe.

Currently, the focus is primarily on **Mechanics**, and other fields such as **Thermodynamics** and **Optics** will be integrated in the future.

### **Mathematics**:
NewtonOS will include powerful mathematical tools for:
  - Algebra, calculus, and geometry
  - Linear algebra, matrices, and systems of equations
  - Differential equations and other advanced topics

The math module will help users solve complex problems and visualize solutions. In the future, NewtonOS will integrate more advanced topics and mathematical visualizations.

### **Chemistry**:
NewtonOS will also support chemistry-related tools, but currently, it is in the early stages of development. Future updates will focus on:
  - Chemical reactions, balancing equations, and stoichiometry
  - Thermochemistry, chemical kinetics, and equilibrium
  - Organic and inorganic chemistry

## Future Goals

NewtonOS is currently under development, and the focus is on building out the **mechanics** module. However, the long-term goal is to transform NewtonOS into a complete STEM platform that will provide tools for **Physics**, **Mathematics**, **Chemistry**, and more.

In the future, NewtonOS will evolve into:
- A **Desktop App**: Making NewtonOS accessible for on-the-go problem-solving.
- A **full-fledged operating system**: A lightweight OS focused on STEM, with various applications to help students and professionals in their work.

As the project grows, more functionalities and topics will be added, and the software will be refined to support a wide variety of STEM problems and simulations.

## Current Status

As of now, the project is still in the early stages, and I am primarily working on **Mechanics**. The system is being developed step-by-step, and as I progress with the modules, I will gradually expand it to cover other topics in Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry.
